    <h1>
      A radioactive capsule is missing in Australia. It’s tiny and potentially
      deadly
    </h1>

    <p>
      It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack – an 8mm by 6mm silver
      capsule, no bigger than a coin, believed to be lost somewhere along a
      stretch of vast desert highway in Australia’s biggest state. Mining
      company Rio Tinto issued an apology on Monday saying it was supporting
      state government efforts to find the capsule, which contains Caesium-137,
      a highly radioactive substance used in mining equipment. Rio Tinto said it
      has checked all roads in and out of the Gudai-Darri mine site in remote
      northern Western Australia, where the device was located before a
      contractor collected it for the journey south to the state capital, Perth.
      Authorities believe the capsule, which emits both gamma and beta rays,
      fell off the back of a truck trundling along a 1,400 kilometer (870 miles)
      section of the Great Northern Highway – a distance longer than the
      Californian coastline. Due to the tiny size of the capsule and the huge
      distances involved, authorities warn the chances of finding it are slim.
      And there are fears that it may have already been carried further from the
      search zone, creating a radioactive health risk for anyone who comes
      across it for potentially the next 300 years.

    <h1>How did it go missing</h1>

    <p>
      State authorities raised the alarm on Friday, alerting residents to the
      presence of a radioactive spill across a southern swathe of the state,
      including in the north-eastern suburbs of Perth, the state’s capital, home
      to around 2 million people. According to authorities, the capsule was
      placed inside a package on January 10 and collected from Rio Tinto’s
      Gudai-Darri mine site by a contractor on January 12. The vehicle spent
      four days on the road and arrived in Perth on January 16 but was only
      unloaded for inspection on January 25 – when it was discovered missing.
      “Upon opening the package, it was found that the gauge was broken apart
      with one of the four mounting bolts missing and the source itself and all
      screws on the gauge also missing,” said the Department of Fire and
      Emergency Services (DFES). They believe that strong vibrations caused by
      bumpy roads damaged the package – dislodging a mounting bolt that held it
      in place.

    <h1>How rare is it to lose a radioactive device?</h1>

    <p>
      The incident has come as a shock to experts who said that handling of
      radioactive materials like Caesium-137 is highly regulated with strict
      protocols for their transport, storage and disposal. Rio Tinto said it
      regularly transports and stores dangerous good as part of its business and
      hires expert contractors to handle radioactive materials. The tiny capsule
      was part of a density gauge used at the Gudai-Darri mine site to measure
      the density of iron ore feed in the crushing circuit, it said in a
      statement. Radiation Services WA says radioactive substances are
      transported throughout Western Australia on a daily basis without any
      issues. “In this case, there seems to be a failure of the control measures
      typically implemented,” it said, adding that it had nothing to do with the
      capsule’s loss. Pradip Deb, a lecturer and radiation safety officer at
      RMIT University in Melbourne, said the loss of the capsule was “very
      unusual” as Australian safety rules require them to be transported in
      highly protective cases. The name of the logistics company used to
      transport the device has not been released, Rio Tinto said.
